My name's Manny Calavera, I'm your new travel agent (nope, not really, just a fun quote)
---

- üåç I am located in Tallinn, Estonia

- üá™üá™ I have Estonian citizenship

- üñ•Ô∏è Lately, I've been working mostly with iOS apps and the Bluetooth stack (but also so many, many other things)


# Interests

- SwiftUI (for anything Apple)

- Elm (for anything web front-end development)

- TypeScript

- Kotlin (I guess, for absolutely anything these days, thanks to Kotlin Multiplatform)

- Recently dabbled in Python and Django, found it moderately fun and fast for web front- and back-end development

- Helping people to get into programming (so far, two success stories)

## [Tallink](https://www.tallink.com)

- Back-end for Tallink's customer booking solution. Worked with Java for approximately a year. I joined the project during its final phase, so I've made only minor contributions. The system is now considered legacy and no longer accessible.

- Front-end for Tallink's cargo transfer booking solution. Developed using ExtJS. Contributed to the project for approximately one year. This internal system facilitates cargo vehicle booking exclusively for Tallink operators and is not publicly accessible.

- Back-end for Tallink's current desktop booking solution. Involved in the project from its early stages. Developed the product from scratch using cutting-edge technologies and practices, in collaboration with multiple companies, notably Reaktor from Finland. Worked closely with Tallink's business, UI/UX team, testers, and developers in a large team. Utilized Java and Scala for coding. The project followed a rigorous test-driven approach with full test coverage. The live project can be accessed at https://booking.tallink.com, attracting hundreds of thousands of daily users.

- Front-end for Tallink's current mobile web booking solution. I've led a team of five developers, multiple manual testers, and UI/UX designers. Built the solution from scratch on top of the existing back-end used by the desktop booking system, which I also contributed to. Initially developed using AngularJS and Kefir as the core technologies, and later fully rewritten in Elm, which I consider the most advanced web technology to date. Dedicated approximately two years to this project, ensuring full test coverage of the code. The live project can be accessed at https://mobile.tallink.com.

- Android and iOS native applications for Tallink - done concurrently over a two-year period. Responsible for the final architecture of both apps. Implemented the Android app using Kotlin and leveraged RxJava extensively. For iOS, utilized Swift along with UIKit and RxSwift, and MVVM architecture. Both applications are available in the app stores under the name "Tallink & Silja Line". By the end of my involvement in these projects in 2019, the cumulative downloads for both apps exceeded one million. Ensured approximately 80% test coverage for each application. Conducted research and prototyped with React Native to explore hybrid development approaches for increased development speed.
